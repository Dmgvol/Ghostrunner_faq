# Ghostrunner stability survey and results

Henry has created a form that anyone can fill out with information regarding the game's stability. By collecting information like hardware specification of players as well as some game data, we might be able to find patterns in crashes, slowdowns, etc. which could aid us, but more importantly the developers.

## We need your help!
The google form can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeZAfXEQFOXgmMUOHrxbbw_rgB-OjeemlzAoN8KlC6YE9C_A/viewform). The form is for the most part anonymous (as anonymous as google forms can be), with an **optional** question about your SRC.

## Form results

 Results of the form will be posted [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a2WJ970XR1T2sQQuNKpIjLB9elRCIR_yQllBmu_qEac/edit#gid=1525054650) for now, overtime we will try to generate more visual aids for locating patterns within the issues.
